## Introduction
AtliQ H/W is a computer hardware manufacturer supplying equipment and peripherals to various clients across India, including Excel Stores, Nomad Stores, Surge Stores, and Electricalsara Stores. The company has its head office in Delhi and several regional offices across India. Bhavin Patel, the Sales Director, is facing challenges in tracking sales performance in a fast-changing market. He relies on verbal reports from regional managers, but these reports often present an overly optimistic picture. This has led to frustration as the actual sales performance is declining, and Bhavin needs data-driven insights to understand the weak areas and make informed decisions to increase sales.


## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard to provide Bhavin Patel with accurate, real-time insights into the sales performance across regions, customers, and products. This dashboard will enable him to make data-driven decisions to boost sales and improve profitability for AtliQ H/W.


## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Sales Analysis (2017-2020)**: The dashboard provides key insights into the company’s sales over four years, with a particular focus on the revenue and sales trends in 2020.
- **Profitability Analysis**: Detailed analysis of profit margins, regional contributions, and the performance of key products.
- **Market and Customer Insights**: Identifies underperforming markets and key customers, providing actionable insights to optimize the business strategy.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Filters and slicers allow for dynamic interaction with the data, enabling more granular analysis.


## Steps Involved
This project was developed following a structured approach:
1. **Data Collection**: Collected sales data from 2017 to 2020, including revenue, sales quantities, profit margins, and customer details in SQL file format(Sales database). [View Data Source](https://github.com/KomalSharma0/Blinkit-Sales-Analysis-Power-Bi-/blob/main/BlinkIT%20Grocery%20Data.xlsx)
2. **Data Walkthrough**: Explored and analyzed the data structure in SQL to gain a deeper understanding of the variables and relationships.
3. **Data Importing**: Imported the data into Power BI to begin the dashboard creation process.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Performed data cleaning by handling duplicates, missing values, and ensuring consistent data formatting.
5. **Data Modeling**: Developed relationships between tables and structured the data for easy access and optimized performance in the Power BI dashboard.
6. **DAX Calculations**: Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom calculations such as total revenue, profit margins, and various other business metrics.
7. **Charts Development and Formatting**: Created visualizations such as bar graphs, line charts, and tables to represent the data effectively and provide quick insights.
8. **Dashboard Development**: Designed an intuitive dashboard that consists of key metrics, trends, and insights on sales performance.

  
## Business Insights
### 1. Revenue Growth and Decline (2017-2020) 
* **Rapid Growth (2017-2018):** AtliQ H/W experienced remarkable growth between 2017 (₹93M) and 2018 (₹414M). This growth was largely driven by market expansion, favorable economic conditions, and a strong focus on top-performing customers, leading to a substantial increase in revenue.
* **Consistent Decline (2019-2020):** Revenue dropped to ₹336M in 2019 and further plummeted to ₹142M in 2020. A sharp decline post-February 2020 was observed, primarily due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, other internal factors, such as market saturation and a lack of diversification, may have contributed to this trend as well.

### 2. Market Segmentation and Performance 
* **Regional Focus:** Delhi NCR remains the highest revenue-generating region, contributing ₹75M in 2020, which accounts for 53% of the total revenue. Meanwhile, Bhubaneswar and Lucknow have been underperforming in terms of revenue generation. However, Bhubaneswar's market presents a positive side, as it has shown potential for recovery and could become profitable with targeted strategies, owing to its consistent customer base despite declining revenue.
* **Customer Type:** A significant portion of revenue comes from brick-and-mortar stores. This highlights a major opportunity for AtliQ to expand its e-commerce channel, especially in a post-pandemic era where digital sales are increasingly crucial for business continuity.

### 3. Top Customers and Products
* **Revenue Concentration:** The top five customers, including Electricalsara Stores (₹66M), continue to dominate sales, which poses a risk of over-reliance. A heavy dependency on a few clients could expose AtliQ to potential revenue volatility if these customers reduce their orders.
* **Product Performance:** Of the products sold, 58 items are categorized in the "red zone," generating either zero or negative profit margins. This signals an urgent need for portfolio optimization, especially to ensure that products which consistently underperform are reevaluated or discontinued.

### 4. Profitability by Market
* **Geographical Profitability:** Despite Delhi NCR being the top revenue generator, Mumbai leads in terms of profitability with a 23.9% profit margin. On the other hand, Lucknow reports negative profits (-2.7% margin), while Bhubaneswar, despite its revenue struggles, has shown potential to improve its profitability, particularly through operational improvements and customer engagement initiatives.
* **Profit Trends:** Markets like Surat, Delhi NCR, and Kanpur are showing minimal profit margins. This indicates an opportunity to boost profitability through better cost management and strategic sales approaches in these regions.
  
  
## Recommendations
### 1. Revenue Stabilization
* **Post-COVID Strategy:** Diversify revenue streams by expanding the e-commerce channel and running targeted promotions during peak months.
* **Revitalize Declining Markets:** Focus on improving underperforming markets like Bhubaneswar and Lucknow with tailored campaigns and customer engagement.
  
### 2. Product Portfolio Optimization
* **Reevaluate Low-Profit Products:** Discontinue or renegotiate terms for the 58 underperforming products to improve margins.
* **Focus on High-Margin Products:** Increase marketing for top-performing, high-margin products to boost profitability.
  
### 3. Enhance Profit Margins in Key Markets
* **Operational Efficiency:** Improve cost management in high-revenue markets like Delhi NCR to enhance profitability.
* **Turnaround Low-Margin Markets:** Address negative and low margins in Lucknow and Kanpur through operational improvements.
  
### 4. Diversification of Customer Base
* **Reduce Dependency on Top Customers:** Expand partnerships and strengthen e-commerce to reduce reliance on a few large customers.
* **Customer Retention:** Implement loyalty programs and tailored solutions to retain top customers like Electricalsara Stores.
