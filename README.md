## Introduction
AtliQ H/W is a computer hardware manufacturer supplying equipment and peripherals to various clients across India, including Excel Stores, Nomad Stores, Surge Stores, and Electricalsara Stores. The company has its head office in Delhi and several regional offices across India. Bhavin Patel, the Sales Director, is facing challenges in tracking sales performance in a fast-changing market. He relies on verbal reports from regional managers, but these reports often present an overly optimistic picture. This has led to frustration as the actual sales performance is declining, and Bhavin needs data-driven insights to understand the weak areas and make informed decisions to increase sales.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard to provide Bhavin Patel with accurate, real-time insights into the sales performance across regions, customers, and products. This dashboard will enable him to make data-driven decisions to boost sales and improve profitability for AtliQ H/W.
